# Pig-game

This is a very cool project called Pig Game that I learned from Jonas Schmedtmann ( An instructor from Udemy). 

Rules:  
1. On a turn, a player rolls the die ðŸŽ² repeatedly. 
2. The goal is accumulating as many points as possible, adding up (holding) the numbers rolled on the die ðŸŽ². 
3. However, suppose a player rolls a 1. In that case, the player's turn is over, and any points they have accumulated during this turn are forfeited.
4. Rolling a 1 doesn't wipe out your entire score from previous turns, just the total earned during that particular roll. 
5. A player must choose to hold (stop rolling the die ðŸŽ²) if they do not want to take a chance of rolling a 1 and losing all their points from this turn. 6. If the player chooses to hold, all the points rolled during that turn are added to his or her score. When a player reaches 100 points, the game ends, and that player is the winner.

Takeaway: I learned how to manipulate HTML classes using Javascript. And I also learned one of the most crucial things in programming: scoping. I learned how to reuse code and refactor code.
